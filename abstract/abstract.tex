    This work proposes the development of an intelligent purchasing system for restaurants, based on a mathematical demand prediction model. This model utilizes advanced statistical techniques and forecasting methods to analyze past consumption patterns and accurately forecast the quantities of inputs needed in the future. Additionally, a trained neural network is incorporated to further enhance demand estimations, thereby allowing for the reduction of food waste, optimization of inventory levels, and improvement in restaurant operational efficiency. The research methodology involves the collection and analysis of historical sales and purchasing data, as well as the exploration of various forecasting techniques and neural network algorithms. Experiments will be conducted to assess the system's effectiveness in terms of cost reduction, inventory management, and overall customer satisfaction.

    Ultimately, this thesis aims to contribute to the development of an effective purchasing system that enables restaurants to make informed and timely decisions regarding input procurement. The combination of a mathematical demand prediction model with neural networks represents an innovative approach to addressing inventory management challenges in the gastronomy industry, with the goal of enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability.
